title: Zachary Brooks - Full Stack Developer
intro: Full stack developer with a passion for Frontend Development
description: >-
  I've been working as a software developer for the past 4 years and originally
  started working mainly with backend systems in C# since that what I focused on
  during my time at the University of Northern Colorado. It wasn't until after I
  had graduated and started working at Frontier Airlines that I was introduced
  the Vue.js and fell in love with frontend development. Currently I work as a
  Full Stack Developer for Frontier Airlines and work both with Vue.js and .NET
  Core primarily.
