  I've been working as a software developer for the past 4 years and originally
  started working mainly with backend systems in C# since that what I focused on
  during my time at the University of Northern Colorado. It wasn't until after I
  had graduated and started working at Frontier Airlines that I was introduced
  the Vue.js and fell in love with frontend development. Currently I work as a
  Full Stack Developer for Frontier Airlines and work both with Vue.js and .NET
  Core primarily.


  In my free time, I like to do a variety of things. I play a lot of video games
  since that is originally what got me into development in the first place, The
  Witcher 3,  Mass Effect, and Nier: Automata being some of my favorites. I love
  to listen to a variety of music from K-Pop to Metalcore, Jazz to Chiptune, I
  like to think it's quite eclectic. My love of music has also inspired me to
  start creating Beat Saber maps for some of my favorite tracks! I also run a
  weekly podcast about pop culture which you can read more about at here
