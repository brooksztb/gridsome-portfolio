personal_description: |-
  I've been working as a software developer for the past 4 years and originally started working mainly with back end systems in C# since that what I focused on during my time at the University of Northern Colorado and was really interested in game development. It wasn't until after I had graduated and started working at Frontier Airlines that I was introduced the Vue.js and fell in love with web and front end development. Currently I work as a Full Stack Developer for Frontier Airlines and work both with Vue.js and .NET Core primarily. I am also a co-organizer of the JAMStack Denver Meetup and run the audio/video piece for the group as well as have given a couple of presentations.

  In my free time, I like to do a variety of things. I play a lot of video games since that is originally what got me into development in the first place, The Witcher 3, Mass Effect, and Nier:Automata being some of my favorites. I love to listen to a variety of music from K-Pop to Metalcore, Jazz to Chiptune, I like to think it's quite eclectic. My love of music has also inspired me to start creating Beat Saber maps for some of my favorite tracks! In the winter time I like to go snowboarding up in the beautiful Colorado mountains, and I recently started getting into photography as well.
