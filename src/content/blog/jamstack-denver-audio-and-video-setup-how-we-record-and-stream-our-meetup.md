author: Zach Brooks

content: "I am an co-organizer of the JAMStack Denver meetup and also the A/V guru
  for streaming and recording all of the talks at our meetup. After our February 2020
  meetup, we got a lot of other groups and people interested in how we have things
  setup for recording and live streaming everything. So I thought it would be best
  to explain everything in a post here for others interested in recording/streaming
  their own meetups, and what I use to do everything at JAMStack Denver. \n\nI will
  be breaking everything down in the following sections:  \n  \n**Hardware**  \n**Software
  \ \nSoftware Settings  \nTwitch Settings  \nCreating Thumbnails  \nUploading to
  Youtube  \n  \n**  \n**Hardware**\n\nI'll start with the hardware I use for my setup,
  some cheaper alternatives I recommend, and the minimum set of hardware you'll need
  to get started.\n\n* **My Setup**\n  * [2019 Macbook Pro 16 inch 2.3GHz 8â€‘core](https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-gray-2.3ghz-8-core-processor-1tb)\n
