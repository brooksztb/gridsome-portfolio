I am an co-organizer of the JAMStack Denver meetup and also the A/V guru for streaming and recording all of the talks at our meetup. After our February 2020 meetup, we got a lot of other groups and people interested in how we have things setup for recording and live streaming everything. So I thought it would be best to explain everything in a post here for others interested in recording/streaming their own meetups, and what I use to do everything at JAMStack Denver.

I will be breaking everything down in the following sections:

**Hardware**  
**Software  
Software Settings  
Twitch Settings  
Creating Thumbnails  
Uploading to Youtube**

**Hardware**

I'll start with the hardware I use for my setup, some cheaper alternatives I recommend, and the minimum set of hardware you'll need to get started.

Here's a diagram of how I have everything connected as well for reference:

At first glance this is quite a bit of hardware. Some of it is a bit overkill for creating a simple live stream, like the Mirrorless DSLR I use, but I use the camera for photography as well and it doubles as a great live streaming camera. The 8 core Macbook Pro I have isn't necessary either, but for streaming and recording I would recommend at least a computer with 4 CPU cores if not 6 due to the video encoding being CPU bound. With that said, this is what I would recommend for an ideal setup.

**Recommended Setup**

* 4-6 core CPU Computer
